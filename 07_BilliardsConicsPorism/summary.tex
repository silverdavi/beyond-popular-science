Poncelet's Porism describes an unexpected property of billiard trajectories between two nested ellipses: if one path returns to its starting point after a finite number of bounces, then all starting points generate periodic trajectories with the same number of bounces. This geometric result connects to elliptic curves and measure-preserving dynamical systems, exemplifying how problems in distinct fields reduce to the same equations through appropriate frameworks.
