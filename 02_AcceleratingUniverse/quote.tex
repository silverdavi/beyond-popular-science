The simplest calculation involves summing the quantum mechanical\\
zero-point energies of all the fields known in Nature. This gives an answer\\
about 120 orders of magnitude higher than the upper limits on \(\Lambda\)\\
set by cosmological observations. This is probably the worst theoretical\\
prediction in the history of physics! Nobody knows how to make sense\\
of this result. Some physics mechanism must exist that makes\\
the cosmological constant very small.
