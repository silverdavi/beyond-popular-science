Deterministic systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, where minuscule differences in initial conditions lead to drastically different outcomes. The double pendulum and three-body gravitational problem exemplify this despite having few components and simple equations. Counterintuitively, far more complex systems like falling objects often behave predictably because dissipative effects continuously suppress perturbations.
