Empty space isn't empty — and even that depends on who's looking. The quantum vacuum teems with field fluctuations, but two observers can fundamentally disagree about whether particles exist. An astronaut floating peacefully sees perfect vacuum. Her twin, accelerating through the same region, is bombarded by thermal radiation at temperature $T = ħa/2πck_B$ — the Unruh effect. Particle content becomes relative, like simultaneity in Einstein's relativity.
